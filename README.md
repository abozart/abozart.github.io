#HTML and CSS Projects

These are some samples of websites I made using HTML/CSS

##Projects
Single Page Site
Space Station Site
Movie Theatre Site

###Space Station Site
This is an example homepage for a space travel company. It's styled using CSS and contains a navbar, header, footers, images containers, and a form.

###Movie Theatre Site
This is an example homepage for a local Movie Theatre that is styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains many Bootstrap 4 components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.
